Description: Python Chromecast media streamer for Linux
 Stream2Chromecast casts audio and video files to a
 Chromecast device from Linux. It can also transcode any
 unsupported files in real time and play them on the
 Chromecast.
 .
 It is written in Python 2.7 and uses either ffmpeg or
 avconv for transcoding.
 This copy modded by wiak (of murga-linux.com/puppy forum) 
 to allow piping from stdin via transcoder ffmpeg or avconv.
