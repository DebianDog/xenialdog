Bugfix for when using encrypted savefile:
If XenialDog is frugally installed using "porteus-boot":
https://github.com/DebianDog/xenialdog/wiki/Porteus-boot
Replace initrd1.xz in the "casper" folder with the one in this directory and encrypted savefile should work.

Note that this is only for kernel version 4.4.0-59-generic (originally included in 2017-01-22 ISO)
